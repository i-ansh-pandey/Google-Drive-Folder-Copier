# Google-Drive-Folder-Copier
This is a Flask-based web application (with Google OAuth, and Drive API ), it allows users to copy the whole folder (subfolders included) either from users or other shared drive links (share link should have permission to open the folder). it  works very well.
Note: Please add your .json file (Because it consists of the client ID, I didn't upload it here.)
